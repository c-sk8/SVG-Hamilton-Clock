# SVG Hamilton Clock

This clock design is based on the Hamilton Khaki Field Expedition Automatic watch. If I am breaking any copyright rules by copying the design of this watch then I am happy to remove this project, but I am a big fan Hamilton watches and the designs they use.

This project uses hand crafted SVG files, and is made into a working clock using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

The size of the clock is fairly small which fits well onto a small display like that of an iPhone. By zooming in using your browser you can fill the screen for larger displays. Because it is made with SVG the shapes will always have sharp edges.
